This is a web application used for testing clj-webdriver. It is hosted on Heroku to make it easy to run clj-webdriver's test suite against the likes of SauceLabs.

## Thank You ##

SauceLabs has created an "Open Sauce" membership plan that allows open source projects like clj-webdriver to test for free on their platform. A big "thank you" to SauceLabs for their support of open source software.
